# TSystem

TSystem is a modular rhythm game library for Unity.

## Features

* All fundamental features for rhythm game
* Note, Parser, Judger, Input and related subscripts are ready for Import-and-Play
* Developer-customizable ingame manager called **Basis**
* User-customizable data file called **Mode**

### Basis

Basis is the "Skeleton" of the game. Basis works as ingame manager which controls time, notes and other managable things.

To write your own Basis, just inherit ```IngameBasis``` to your class.  

You should write overrided methods for:
* ```GetNoteTemplate``` (Returns a ```GameObject``` depending on the note data)
* ```GetNoteImage``` (Returns a ```Sprite``` depending on the note data)
* ```CreeateNote``` (Creates a ```Note``` from the note data)
* ```AfterNoteLoading``` (Called after the notes are fully loaded.)
* ```AddScore``` (Calculates and adds the score from given note data and ```JudgeType```)

### Mode

Mode is the "Skin" of the game. Mode file is NOT a script; it is a JSON-format data file.  
This means that you don't need to modify the binary to change the values from Mode.

Mode includes:
* Name
* Description
* Basis index to use
* Line informations
* Judging informations
* Path informations (Math expression and Bezier points are available for path definition)

## Installing TSystem

Go to Releases, and download the latest package file. Then, in your Unity project, import the downloaded package file.
